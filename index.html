    <p>This is all new to me.<br><br>
    In 2012, I began planning my future while sitting on a bunk in military housing.  I have served my country at home and abroad, travelled the world, and had some amazing adventures.<br>
    <br>I'm 34 years old, I've conducted countless missions across 5 continents and roughly 25 countries.<br>
    <br>And now I am a Code School student, doing something brand new; and I'm eager to learn.</p>
